//! A linter for BPF C code.
//!
//! At the source code level, individual lints can be disabled with
//! source code comments of the form
//! ```c
//! /* bpflint: disable=probe-read */
//! bpf_probe_read(/* ... */);
//! ```
//!
//! In this instance, `probe-read` is the name of the lint to disable.
//!
//! Entire blocks can be annotated as well:
//! ```c
//! /* bpflint: disable=probe-read */
//! void handler(void) {
//!      void *dst = /* ... */
//!      bpf_probe_read(dst, /* ... */);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! In the above examples, none of the instances of `bpf_probe_read`
//! will be flagged.
//!
//! The directive `bpflint: disable=all` acts as a catch-all, disabling
//! reporting of all lints.
